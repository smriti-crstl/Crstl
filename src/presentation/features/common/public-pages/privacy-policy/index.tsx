          We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
          material changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top
          of the Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional
          notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending
          you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy
          often to stay informed about our information practices and the choices

        <GenericHeading>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</GenericHeading>
        <StyledPre>
          The information we collect from you varies depending on the way you
          use our Services. When you simply browse our public website as a
          consumer (&quot;Consumer&quot;) to explore our Services or to learn
          more about us, the information we collect and use is different from
          the information we collect if you become a Crstl business user
          (&quot;Business User&quot;) and purchase and/or license one of our
          products or services. Below, we describe the different ways we might
          collect information from you.

        <GenericSubHeading isGreyDisabled>
          Information You Provide to Us

          We collect information you provide directly to us.
        </StyledPre>
        <Italic>Consumers</Italic>
        <StyledPre>
          For example, when you use our services as a Consumer, if you contact
          us for more information about our company, or otherwise communicate
          with us to learn more about our products and services, we collect
          personal information, which may include:
          <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Address</li>
          </ul>
        </StyledPre>

        <Italic>Business Users</Italic>
        <StyledPre>
          If you become a Business User, we collect certain personal information
          from you and/or your authorized users in order to facilitate our
          business relationship with you and provide you our products and
          services (collectively, &quot;Business Personal Information&quot;).
          Business Personal Information we may collect from you and/or your
          authorized users includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Business Name</li>
            <li>Job Title</li>
            <li>Email address associated with your business</li>
            <li>Postal and billing address</li>
            <li>Phone number</li>
            <li>Account login ID and password, chosen by you</li>
          </ul>
        </StyledPre>

        <StyledPre>
          We also collect information a Business User chooses to provide
          relating to its customers or individuals that it serves
          (&quot;Business Customer&quot;). Business Users must provide their
          Business Customers any required notices and collect any necessary
          consents before providing or disclosing any such information
          (collectively &quot;Business Customer Information&quot;) to us. Crstl
          does not directly collect or control Business Customer Information,
          but rather Business Users determine what Business Customer Information
          they collect from their Business Customers, and to the extent Crstl
          receives that information, we do so on behalf of our Business Users.
